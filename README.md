This Project is the 2nd Project on Udacity Non-degree of Data Analysis a scholership I secured via egFWD organization Egypt.
it goes as follows: a Company wants to decide whether or not to deploy a new landing page design based on the effect both the old and new pages have on the conversion rate, after performing perminilary probability tests, A/B Testing and Logistic Regression on the data I came out with the decision for them to keep the old page with few more suggestions concering the testing condotions and the givin data.
